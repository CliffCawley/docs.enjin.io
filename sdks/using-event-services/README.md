## Alpha Documentation

The documentation for the Enjin SDKs pertain to the Project and Player schemas which are currently in an **Alpha** release. The Project and Player schemas are **not yet publicly available** and therefore this documentation is limited only to those who already have access. For any queries, please contact [Enjin Support](mailto:support@enjin.io).

## Introduction

The Enjin SDKs facilitate usage of listening and processing of events emitted by the Enjin Cloud, which help us deliver a better user-experience in our application and eliminate unnecessary API requests we would otherwise make to the Enjin Platform.
