# Getting Started

## Introduction

The Enjin SDKs provide a framework we may use in our desired programming language to allow our application to more easily interface with the Enjin API and ease our burden as developers.

Before getting started with exploring the Enjin SDKs, we will want to [register](https://enjin.io/software/platform-signup) on the Enjin Platform and create a project that we will be connecting our SDKs to.
