# Getting Started

{% hint style="info" %}
## Alpha Documentation

The documentation for the Enjin SDKs pertain to the Project and Player schemas which are currently in an **Alpha** release. The Project and Player schemas are **not yet publicly available** and therefore this documentation is limited only to those who already have access. For any queries, please contact [Enjin Support](mailto:support@enjin.io).
{% endhint %}

## Introduction

The Enjin SDKs provide a framework we may use in our desired programming language to allow our application to more easily interface with the Enjin API and ease our burden as developers.

Before getting started with exploring the Enjin SDKs, we will want to [register](https://enjin.io/software/platform-signup) on the Enjin Platform and create a project that we will be connecting our SDKs to.
