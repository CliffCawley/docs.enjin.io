## Alpha Documentation

The documentation for the Enjin SDKs pertain to the Project and Player schemas which are currently in an **Alpha** release. The Project and Player schemas are **not yet publicly available** and therefore this documentation is limited only to those who already have access. For any queries, please contact [Enjin Support](mailto:support@enjin.io).

## Introduction

### Project & Player Clients

The SDKs utilize the same project-player schema structure laid out by the [Enjin API](../../core-api/project-and-player-requests/) for making requests to the platform. This means that there will be areas where the clients diverge in their usages and how they are setup.
