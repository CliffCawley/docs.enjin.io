# Dynamically linking Assets with EnjinX

Players are inherently interested in the blockchain data behind the assets and NFTs that they own. 

If you would like to link your users to the EnjinX listing of a specific asset, you can append the token ID to the end of the URL \([https://enjinx.io/eth/asset/](https://enjinx.io/eth/asset/)\). This allows them to learn everything they can about the assets they own.

Note that this will also work for EnjinX Mainnet, EnjinX Kovan and EnjinX JumpNet.
{% endhint %}

## Example

[The Monolith's](https://enjinx.io/eth/asset/7000000000000002) numerical identifier is `7000000000000002`, with this being the **Token ID** of the asset.

Appending the Token ID of the asset to the URL provided above, gives the [following](https://enjinx.io/eth/asset/0x7000000000000002). By linking these together, you will enable your users to view and share their assets via EnjinX.

For Non-Fungible Tokens \(NFTs\), you can also append the Token Index of the NFT, to the URL.

You can see an example here: [https://enjinx.io/eth/asset/5080000000000027/369](https://enjinx.io/eth/asset/5080000000000027/369)

| **Network** | Example URL |
| :--- | :--- |
| Mainnet | https://enjinx.io/eth/asset/5080000000000027/369 |
| JumpNet | https://jumpnet.enjinx.io/eth/asset/70c0000000000b7d/ |
| Kovan | https://kovan.enjinx.io/eth/asset/7800000000000d74/ |
